# DBMS Project

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the implementation of a robust Database Management System (DBMS) infrastructure using SQL, PLSQL, Red Hat, and Bash scripting. The project aims to design and implement a relational database schema for university management, encompassing students, courses, departments, and grades. Additionally, automation scripts have been developed to streamline critical tasks such as database backup, disk space monitoring, and anomaly detection.

## Key Responsibilities

### Database Design
- Developed a relational database schema following normalization principles to ensure data integrity.
- Documented the schema comprehensively for ease of understanding and maintenance.

### SQL Implementation
- Constructed SQL scripts to build the database schema.
- Populated the database with sample data to ensure its correctness.
- Validated the database schema rigorously through testing.

### PLSQL Implementation
- Implemented PLSQL scripts for data manipulation tasks such as updating information and calculating GPA.
- Ensured functionality and efficiency through thorough testing of PLSQL scripts.

### Automation Scripts
- Developed Bash scripts for automating critical tasks including:
  - Database backup to ensure data integrity and disaster recovery.
  - Disk space monitoring to prevent system failures due to low disk space.
  - Anomaly detection for timely identification and resolution of issues.
- Scheduled scripts for timely execution and notifications to relevant stakeholders.

## Usage

- Follow the instructions provided in each directory to utilize the respective scripts and documentation.
